# Getting Started with Hearing Aids

Hearing aids are tools to support communicationâ€”not a cure. Success comes from the right fit, realistic expectations, and consistent practice.

## Fitting and comfort

Work with your clinician to ensure a comfortable physical fit and a sound profile matched to your goals.

## Daily care

- Wipe devices daily and store in a dry case at night
- Keep batteries charged and spares handy
- Schedule follow-ups for fine-tuning
